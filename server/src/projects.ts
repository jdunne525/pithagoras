 * starts chats in Home, which is the agent's own home directory and lives
 * outside the workspace root — so it is not here, and none of this can touch it.
 * A project is an extra folder you make on purpose, with instructions of its
 * own. Nothing here is tied to a session: deleting a chat never touches a
 * folder, and a folder is only ever created or removed by one of the functions
 * below.
 *
 * The instructions are the folder's AGENTS.md, which pi reads on its own when a
 * chat starts in it — there is nothing to hand over, and the file can be edited
 * anywhere.
